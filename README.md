# TouchSign-Bridge
TouchSign Bridge is an innovative solution with the dual functionality of translating Indian sign language to text and audio as well as converting the text to braille. The software aids inclusivity for individuals who face extraordinary challenges while establishing a social connection through verbal communication. It is a web-based application that seamlessly facilitates communication between the specially-abled particularly those with visual and auditory impairments with the general population The system makes use of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning algorithm commonly used in image processing and recognition tasks. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of sign language gestures captured through videos or images, which includes a variety of gestures, variations, and lighting conditions and shows a testing accuracy of 80%. Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech API is being used for audio implementation. Python dictionaries are used for textual to-braille conversion. React was employed on the front end and Flask on the server end to integrate this functionality into a web application.
